            There are many ways of organizing the data in the memory as we have already seen one of the data structures, i.e., array in C language
          </p>
          <p>
          The data structure is not any programming language like C, C++, java, etc. It is a set of algorithms
          that we can use in any programming language to structure the data in the memory.</p>

          <p>  Arrays are defined as the collection of similar type of data items stored at contiguous memory locations.</p>
           <p> Arrays are the derived data type in C programming language which can store the primitive type of data such as int, char, double, float, etc. </p>
          <p>  Array is the simplest data structure where each data element can be randomly accessed by using its index number. </p>
          <p>  For example, if we want to store the marks of a student in 6 subjects, then we don't need to define different variable for the marks in different subject. instead of that, we can define an array which can store the marks in each subject at a the contiguous memory locations. </p>

It contains only one pointer top pointer pointing to the topmost element of the stack. Whenever an element is added in the stack, it is added on the top of the stack, and the element can be deleted only from the stack. In other words, a stack can be defined as a container in which insertion and deletion can be done from the one end known as the top of the stack.</p>
